### notes
i make use of `eruda` which is a browser console, i use it since i code on phone, **why ?** simply because i don't have a **PC** damnit

- your components should always remain pure 
- it should only do one thing
- and it should do it well `(sweet and nice **ui**)`
- all your fn and variablea should be initiated in the App components and passed down to other child components as props.

> i really find the last point helpful, since it makes the child component dependent. 

### todo!
